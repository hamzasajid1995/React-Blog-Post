<!-- App development Info -->
## Info

1. For routing I'm using <b>react router v6</b>. There is a Layout, which has a navbar and an Outlet for all the nested routes. When deploying to a server we'll use <b>BrowserRouter</b> but for now I'm using <b>HashRouter</b> because app is deployed on <b>Github pages</b> and i can't customize server configs to support BrowserRouter.
2. For State management I'm using <b>react-redux</b> with <b>redux-toolkit</b>. I have also added <b>AsyncThunk</b> and <b>EntityAdapter</b>


## Write HTML

React escapes HTML by default, but we can set HTML content of the element using 'INNERHTML' property. In react its called <b>dangerouslySetInnerHTML</b> which lets React know that the HTML inside of that component is not something it cares about.
```
function createMarkup() {
  return {__html: 'First &middot; Second'};
}

function MyComponent() {
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={createMarkup()} />;
}
```
The word dangerous is there because using it carelessly will create XSS vulnerabilities in your application. If you want to use it then you should sanitize your code using packages like **dom-purify with jsdom**
